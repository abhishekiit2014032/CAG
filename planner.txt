3. Confirmed python-dotenv package is already installed

## Current Issue
The error message "Insufficient content extracted from files (less than 100 characters). Cache not created." is coming from the application itself (line 69 in app.py). This occurs when:
- The application tries to extract text from uploaded PDF or DOCX files
- The extracted content is less than 100 characters in length
- This is a validation check in the application, not an API key issue

## Next Steps
1. When using the application, ensure that uploaded PDF or DOCX files contain sufficient text content (more than 100 characters)
2. The API key integration is working correctly, but the application requires valid document files with enough content to process# Gemini API Key Integration Plan

## Current Status
- Found .env file with GEMINI_API_KEY=AIzaSyDH4BBtZ__GDZAjGHTSS4eW0olqwk2brWE
- app.py is currently looking for GOOGLE_API_KEY environment variable

## Action Plan
1. Modify app.py to read from GEMINI_API_KEY instead of GOOGLE_API_KEY
2. Test the application to ensure it can access the API key correctly

## Progress
- [x] Identified the issue: environment variable name mismatch
- [ ] Update app.py to use the correct environment variable name
- [ ] Verify the application works correctly
